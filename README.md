## 🎯 Purpose

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> SUNLU filaments each have their own extrusion and thermal characteristics.  

These profiles are carefully tuned to match those behaviors on the **Bambu Lab H2 Series hotends**, helping ensure:

- Consistent extrusion
- Predictable layer bonding
- Clean surface finishes
- Reduced need for manual tuning per spool

Whether you’re printing functional parts or longer production runs, these profiles aim to provide dependable results out of the box.

## ✅ What’s Included

- Optimized filament profiles for **Bambu Lab H2 Series**
- Tuned specifically for **SUNLU filament materials**
- Balanced settings for **strength, speed, and print quality**
- Suitable for **AMS / AMS 2** workflows
- Drop-in ready profiles — no guesswork

## ⚙️ How to Add Profiles to Bambu Studio

Follow these steps to import the SUNLU H2 Series profiles into your Bambu Studio setup:

1. **Download the profiles**  
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/jjjonesjr33/SUNLU-Bambu-Lab-H2-Series-Profiles/releases) page and download the latest `.zip` file.

2. **Extract the files**  
   - Open the downloaded archive and extract all profile files to a folder on your computer.

3. **Open Bambu Studio**  

4. **Import the profiles**  
   - Navigate to: `File` → `Import` → `Import Configs`  
   - Select **all the extracted profile files**.

5. **Apply the profiles**  
   - The profiles are now available in Bambu Studio. You can select them for your prints and enjoy optimized settings for SUNLU filaments.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep this folder handy — you can re-import any time you want to restore or update profiles.
>
> These were properly set up, imported, and tested with PETG and ASA. I still need to test the PLA series, but all profiles were pulled from the manufacturer’s website and the Bambu Labs GitHub repo. TPU and ABS still need to be added, but this should cover a good chunk of what was missing.

## 🧪 Intended Use

> [!NOTE]
> These profiles are ideal for:
> - Makers who regularly print with **SUNLU filaments**
> - Users looking for **repeatable and consistent results**
> - Anyone wanting to minimize calibration time and failed prints


> [!CAUTION] 
> - Results may vary depending on environment, printer condition, and filament storage
> - Fine-tuning may still be required for highly specific use cases
> - Profiles may evolve as testing continues
